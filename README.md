AppMaker for iOS
================

Description
-----------

AppMaker for iOS is an ongoing experimental, open-source iOS game development project. The game was originally intended to be an example of a real-time multiplayer, strategy simulation game on the mobile iOS platform.

The game was originally conceived as a small university project for the purpose of learning iOS development and demonstrating the capabilities of the technology. It continues to serve as a playground for learning and improving iOS development practices, but as a community open-source project instead, so that our discoveries and experience may be shared with others.
